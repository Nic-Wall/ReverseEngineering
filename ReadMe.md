I have a bit of experience toying with beginner Crackme's, but nothing too difficult. I come from a programming background; knowing a bit of C, a lot of C++, and a decent amount of Linux as an OS (at least for a hobbyist/ someone seeking a career where it's use is prevalent).
This beginner project was written by me to experiment with Ghidra, compiler flags, C, and debuggers. I've toyed with Ghidra, C, and compiler flags in the past but debugging is new to me. In my learning of modules/ drivers for Linux I knew I wanted to incorporate the OS into my first Crackme in some way. I also wanted to make it as winding as possible, with the inclusion of some basic obfuscation methods (hex, ASCII code, pointless functions, etc.).
I don't currently have a Windows device and, after using it as my main OS since middle school, I'm focusing my attention towards Linux. Therefore, while this C file may work on Windows PC's and Mac's, it's intended to be run on Linux; debugging, Ghidra, and the examples showing it run will be on Linux.
This markdown runs through each function and how I parsed it with Ghidra and/or a debugger. The source code will be displayed next to the Ghidra output, but it will only be referenced to point out when I've learned something new/ fun facts not as a guide to how it's analyzed in Ghidra. Including some details/ comparisons between the source code and what Ghidra defaults to.
With all that out of the way, time to get started learning!
